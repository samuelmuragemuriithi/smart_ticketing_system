## Database Schema

The system uses a NoSQL database (Firebase) for flexible data management.

1. User
   - `email`: User's email address
   - `role`: User's role (e.g., Agent, Admin)

   - `photo_url`: URL to user's photo

2. TicketData
   - `title`: Title of the ticket
   - `assigned_agent`: The agent assigned to the ticket
   - `status`: Status of the ticket (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Completed)
   - `description`: Description of the issue
   - `due_date`: Due date for ticket completion
   - `estimated_time`: Estimated time to resolve the ticket

3. AgentData
   - `status`: Current status of the agent (Online/Offline)
   - `name`: Agent's name
   - `current_ticket_load`: Number of tickets currently assigned to the agent
   - `start_shift`: Agent's shift start time
   - `shift_end`: Agent's shift end time

4. AutoAssignedTickets
   - `assigned_agent`: Agent assigned to the ticket
   - `assigned_at`: Time the ticket was assigned
   - `due_date`: Due date for ticket completion
   - `status`: Current status of the assigned ticket
   - `title`: Title of the ticket
   - `IsDone`: Status to check if the task is completed

## Features

- Ticket Creation: Users can create support tickets with details such as title, description, due date, and estimated work hours.
- Automatic Ticket Assignment: Tickets are automatically assigned to online agents who are not currently overloaded, considering their shift schedules.
- Agent Availability and Shift Management: The system tracks the online status, current ticket load, and shift schedules of agents to assign tickets appropriately.
- Manual Ticket Assignment by Support: Support team members can manually assign tickets from the queue to agents based on their workload and expertise.
- Reassigning Tickets: Tickets from the queue are automatically reassigned to agents as they become available.
